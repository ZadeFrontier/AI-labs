# Java-based chatbot application

This application implements a simple chatbot backed by Quarkus and its
LangChain4j extension. The UI communicates with the backend application via
web sockets and the backend uses the OpenAI API to talk to the model served
by Podman AI Lab.

Documentation for Quarkus+LangChain4j can be found at
